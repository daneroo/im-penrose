import GetGraphQL from '../../src/components/get-graphql.js'


This Shows the `GetGraphQL` component, which has dependencies:

```bash
npm i swr graphql-request
```

Here we are using a composition of `useSWR`, and `graphql-request` as it's fetcher:

```js
import { request } from 'graphql-request'
import useSWR from 'swr'

const externalUrl = 'https://fizzbuzzclock.n.imetrical.com/graphql'
const fetcher = query => request(externalUrl, query)

```

```jsx
<GetGraphQL />
```

<GetGraphQL />
