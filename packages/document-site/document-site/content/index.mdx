I am looking for a good base theme for all my simple sites. 
I had previously been using [docz](https://www.docz.site/) 
which is now also based on a gatsby-theme (<https://github.com/doczjs/docz/tree/master/core/gatsby-theme-docz>).

However I now prefer the Document Theme by CodeBushi. On which this site is based.

## Bootstrapping

Until I make my own theme/starter: @daneroo/gatsby-theme-base

This is an example site using the Gatsby theme [Document](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-theme-document)
 by [Code Bushi](https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters-and-themes/).
 [Live Demo](https://gatsby-theme-document.netlify.com/)

It was boostrapped with:

```bash
gatsby new document-site https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-theme-document-example.git
cd document-site
gatsby develop
```


Then customize the `gatsby-config.js` for SiteMetadata, SocialLinks, and:
```json
sidebarConfig: {
  forcedNavOrder: ["/introduction", "/codeblock"],
  ignoreIndex: true
}
```

## Styling

The theme already supports styiling with theme-ui, and even has multiple modes and swithcher.

### Typography

In `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`, added:

```js
import 'typeface-roboto' // npm i typeface-roboto
import 'typeface-roboto-mono' // npm i typeface-roboto-mono
```

after installing `npm i typeface-roboto typeface-roboto-mono`, for local serving

### Added style-guide

This plugin generates a <a href="/style-guide">style guide page</a>

```bash
npm i gatsby-theme-style-guide
```

And in `gatsby-config.js`:
```json
{
  plugins: [
    ...
    'gatsby-theme-style-guide'
  ]
}
```
