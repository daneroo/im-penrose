# Gatsby Trials

I am using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (v2), and these are minimal examples to de-risk things I need:

- Setup VSCode / lint / format
- Hooks
- Dynamic client side querying (fetch)
  - Same with GraphQL
- Styling:
  - Integrate Material Design
  - Emotion
- D3
  - with inline data
  - with Dynamic data

Each of these is in it's own repo, and each should start with a minimal app.

```bash
npx gatsby new experimentname https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
```
