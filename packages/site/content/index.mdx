I am moving the im-penrose direcory into Gatsby!

Start with  <Link to="/basics/">the basics</Link>

## History
This is a gatsby site, building on some early JS experiments, mostly in SVG.

I also entered a vartiant of this work into the [JS1K Contrest](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1437)

*This is the contest blurb:*

#### A Penrose by any other name

With 5 dimensions this yields a Penrose Tiling;
a 5-fold symmetric non-periodic tiling of the plane.

Rich geometric subject, and beautiful tiling.
squeezing it into 1k - priceless

`tl;dr`

n-Dimensional hypercube lattice projection onto an n-fold symmetric tiling of the plane.
Random animation with n=3,5,7

### Site

The site was bootstraped from Gatsby theme [Document](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-theme-document)
 by [Code Bushi](https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters-and-themes/).
 [Live Demo](https://gatsby-theme-document.netlify.com/)
